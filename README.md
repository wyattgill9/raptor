# Enhanced Raptor Server Development Checklist with Performance Optimization

## Ultra-Low Latency Features
1. [ ] **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Avoids unnecessary data copying for faster message delivery.
2. [ ] **Kernel-Bypass Networking**: Utilizes technologies like DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) for direct access to the network card, bypassing traditional kernel overhead.
3. [ ] **Optimized for Sub-Millisecond Latencies**: Ensures performance even under high-throughput conditions.

## High Throughput Capabilities
1. [ ] **Parallelism**: Multi-threaded architecture to make efficient use of CPU resources.
2. [ ] **Batching**: Groups messages to minimize network overhead and maximize throughput.
3. [ ] **Custom Network Protocol**: Built on UDP with added reliability for higher throughput and lower latency compared to traditional TCP.

## Custom Serialization Techniques
1. [ ] **Efficient Binary Serialization**: Optimized for smaller message sizes and faster processing.

## Scalability Enhancements
1. [ ] **Seamless Horizontal Scaling**: Nodes can be added to handle increased traffic without causing downtime.
2. [ ] **Automatic Load Balancing**: Dynamically distributes load across available nodes for optimal resource usage.
3. [ ] **Elastic Scaling**: Capable of adapting to sudden spikes in traffic.

## High Availability Mechanisms
1. [ ] **Replication and Durability**: Ensures messages are not lost during system failures.
2. [ ] **Fast Recovery**: Quick failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.
3. [ ] **Smart Backpressure Handling**: Stabilizes system performance under heavy loads.

## Real-Time Data Delivery
1. [ ] **Push-Based Message Delivery**: Enables near-instantaneous message propagation to consumers.
2. [ ] **Low Latency Streams**: Built for real-time use cases like analytics, financial data, and IoT.

## Resource Efficiency
1. [ ] **Low Resource Footprint**: Optimized to run on minimal hardware while maintaining high performance.
2. [ ] **Supports Lightweight Deployments**: Suitable for edge devices and high-density server environments.

- [ ] Develop additional monitoring and debugging tools.
