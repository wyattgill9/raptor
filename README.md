# Raptor Protocol üöÄ  
**Ultra-Low Latency, Hyperscalable Messaging Protocol**

Raptor is a high-performance, custom messaging protocol designed for extreme scalability and ultra-low latency. Built with cutting-edge techniques like zero-copy mechanisms, kernel-bypass networking, and custom serialization, Raptor aims to redefine message delivery for distributed systems.

## Features ‚ú®

### ‚úÖ **Ultra-Low Latency**
- [x] **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Avoids unnecessary data copying for faster message delivery.
- [x] **Kernel-Bypass Networking**: Leverages technologies like DPDK for direct access to the network card, bypassing traditional kernel overhead.
- [x] Optimized for sub-millisecond latencies, even at high throughput.

### ‚úÖ **High Throughput**
- [x] **Parallelism**: Multi-threaded architecture ensures efficient use of CPU resources.
- [x] **Batching**: Groups messages to minimize network overhead and maximize throughput.
- [x] **Custom Network Protocol**: Built on UDP with added reliability for higher throughput and lower latency compared to traditional TCP.

### ‚úÖ **Custom Serialization**
- [x] **Efficient Binary Serialization**: Optimized for smaller message sizes and faster processing.
- [x] Extensible message formats for both fixed and variable-length data.
- [x] Schema evolution support to adapt to changing message structures.

### ‚úÖ **Scalability**
- [x] **Seamless Horizontal Scaling**: Easily add more nodes to handle increased traffic without downtime.
- [x] **Automatic Load Balancing**: Dynamically distributes load across nodes for optimal resource usage.
- [x] Elastic scaling to meet sudden spikes in traffic.

### ‚úÖ **High Availability**
- [x] **Replication and Durability**: Ensures messages are not lost during failures.
- [x] **Fast Recovery**: Quick failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.
- [x] Smart backpressure handling for stability under heavy loads.

### ‚úÖ **Real-Time Data Delivery**
- [x] **Push-Based Message Delivery**: Enables near-instantaneous message propagation to consumers.
- [x] **Low Latency Streams**: Built for real-time use cases like analytics, financial data, and IoT.

### ‚úÖ **Resource Efficiency**
- [x] **Low Resource Footprint**: Optimized to run on minimal hardware while maintaining high performance.
- [x] Supports lightweight deployments for edge devices and high-density server environments.
