# Raptor Protocol üöÄ  
**Ultra-Low Latency, Hyperscalable Messaging Protocol**

Raptor is a high-performance, custom messaging protocol designed for extreme scalability and ultra-low latency. Built with cutting-edge techniques like zero-copy mechanisms, kernel-bypass networking, and custom serialization, Raptor aims to redefine message delivery for distributed systems.

## Features ‚ú®

### **Ultra-Low Latency**
- [ ] **Zero-Copy Data Transfer**: Avoids unnecessary data copying for faster message delivery.
- [ ] **Kernel-Bypass Networking**: Leverages technologies like DPDK for direct access to the network card, bypassing traditional kernel overhead.
- [ ] Optimized for sub-millisecond latencies, even at high throughput.

### **High Throughput**
- [ ] **Parallelism**: Multi-threaded architecture ensures efficient use of CPU resources.
- [ ] **Batching**: Groups messages to minimize network overhead and maximize throughput.
- [ ] **Custom Network Protocol**: Built on UDP with added reliability for higher throughput and lower latency compared to traditional TCP.

### **Custom Serialization**
- [ ] **Efficient Binary Serialization**: Optimized for smaller message sizes and faster processing.
- [ ] Extensible message formats for both fixed and variable-length data.
- [ ] Schema evolution support to adapt to changing message structures.

### **Scalability**
- [ ] **Seamless Horizontal Scaling**: Easily add more nodes to handle increased traffic without downtime.
- [ ] **Automatic Load Balancing**: Dynamically distributes load across nodes for optimal resource usage.
- [ ] Elastic scaling to meet sudden spikes in traffic.

### **High Availability**
- [ ] **Replication and Durability**: Ensures messages are not lost during failures.
- [ ] **Fast Recovery**: Quick failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.
- [ ] Smart backpressure handling for stability under heavy loads.

### **Real-Time Data Delivery**
- [ ] **Push-Based Message Delivery**: Enables near-instantaneous message propagation to consumers.
- [ ] **Low Latency Streams**: Built for real-time use cases like analytics, financial data, and IoT.

### **Resource Efficiency**
- [ ] **Low Resource Footprint**: Optimized to run on minimal hardware while maintaining high performance.
- [ ] Supports lightweight deployments for edge devices and high-density server environments.

## Roadmap üõ†Ô∏è
- [ ] Implement advanced reliability mechanisms for UDP.
- [ ] Add support for RDMA-like transport for further latency reductions.
- [ ] Benchmark against existing protocols (Kafka, Redpanda).
- [ ] Integrate Raptor with Rafka as a messaging layer.
- [ ] Develop additional monitoring and debugging tools.
